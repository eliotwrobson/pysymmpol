# pySymmPol: Symmetric Polynomials

This is a python package for manipulation of some symmetric 
polynomials (or functions). Among them, we have 

1. Complete homogeneous Symmetric Functions
2. Elementary symmetric polynomials
3. Monomial symmetric polynomials 
4. Schur polynomials
5. Hall-Littlewood polynomials

Moreover, we have a module with basic functionalities for integer partitions 
and Young Diagrams manipulation.
